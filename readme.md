# Introduction

## how this works

the course you've found yourself in is a study on javascript patterns book that will be written by jasmine tests. If that sounds weird to you then you're probably in the wrong place. If you're into this then read on.

This repo is for chapter 1.
since it's a github repo, it uses issues.


## your responsibility

is to submit an issue with your jasmine tested notes about javascript patterns. An issue is simply you making your code public. It will not harm you or any other code bases. So, you will make an issue, and push your chapter 1 related comments and questions in your issue. you will be pleasantly surprised that github makes conversations about code very easy because we get immediate context.

## example

my name is @wwwoodall and my commits and issues will be an example for you. feel free to ping me with comments and/or questions on my commits. That's what issues are for :-)

## about

learn the tools by using the tools.

### Jasmine 2.3

we'll be using [jasmine 2.3](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases) as it's the latest release

## assignments
- pull down jasmine
- make sure you can see the example `Player` and `Song` tests passing. from `jasmine-standalone-2.3.4/SpecRunner.html`
- poke around and see that they are working.

- this is an example of chapter one notes which I'll type out later.

## An interactive approach to learning

Rather than writing questions or notes, you are writing code while learning two additional required skills;
- how to use github
- how to test in Jasmine

It's also entirely possible that you already know Jasmine but never read JavaScript Patterns. You would also benefit from learning the raw funadmentals of the JS language you might not otherwise discover in production.

# introducing pull requests
If you are familiar with PR's then you can skip this section. For those of you new to collaborating on Github, then this is an additional skill you will develop in this course. This course will teach you professional grade, distributed team code collaboration with the following approach per student.

- Fork the main repo
- clone your forked repo locally
- make your code comments
- push your code to your *forked* copy
- click 'create pr' on github and it will connect you with the 'mama' repo that you originally broke from and made your own changes. 

Once you click create pr, you'll see some comments for notes which you can add. feel free to add any relevant information there.

At that point once you hit submit, then the mother code base will have the ability to merge your code, or pull it into the master code. But that is where _real_ code and this course divide. Your code title will be

```
    your name : anything whatever you want to say here
```

After you've submitted your pr, then take a look at other student's implementation and use Github's commenting at any level to interact with code written by others 

Students of this course create Pull Requests to be reviewed by the open source community.
